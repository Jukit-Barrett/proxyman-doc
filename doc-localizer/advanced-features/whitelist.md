# Allow List

## 1. What's it?

The Allow List Tool is a handy tool to help you define which domains you **allow to appear** on the Proxyman app.&#x20;

The unmatched requests won't go through Proxyman (by-pass)

It's useful in the following situations:

* Ignore all domains except your debugging domains (e.g. producthunt.com)
* Reduce the number of unnecessary requests, and focus on the domains you need to track

If you would like to block certain domains, please visit [Block Tool](https://docs.proxyman.com/advanced-features/blacklist)

## 2. How to use?

* **Tools** menu -> **Allow List**
* Right-click on the selected request -> **Tools** -> **Allow List**
