## 2. What is different with Map Remote?

DNS Spoofing is different than Map Remote by:

* The \`Host\` in the Request Header doesn't change
* The URL doesn't change

On the other hand, Map Remote allows you to change the Host Header and the mapped URL.

## 3. How to use it?

1. Simply create a new rule by opening the Tools Menu -> DNS Spoofing
2. Create new Rule with the Host name and Remote Address
3. Done ✅
