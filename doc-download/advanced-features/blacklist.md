# Block List

## 1. What's it?

The Block List Tool is useful when you would like to **block or hide** certain domains during a debugging session.

For instance, you can use Block List in the following situations:

* Block all ads requests from particular domains
* Block all analytic requests that flood the working space
* Block all annoying ping requests from your app to reduce the number of requests that appear on Proxyman
* Hide analytic traffic from your website without blocking it.

All blocked domains in the Block List will **drop the connection.**

## 2. Block Actions

Block List supports some block actions that can suit your needs:

<table><thead><tr><th width="238.87890625">Block Action</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Block &#x26; Hide Request</td><td>Matched requests are blocked and don't display on the app.</td></tr><tr><td>Block &#x26; Display</td><td>Matched requests are blocked, but display the blocked requests on the app.</td></tr><tr><td>Hide, but not Block</td><td>Just hiding the matched requests without blocking them. It's useful if you'd hide your annoying requests but don't block them.</td></tr></tbody></table>
