# Publish to Gist

## 1. What's it?

From Proxyman 2.28.0+, the developer can publish Request/Response data to Github Gist.

* Proxyman requires "Read/Write Gist" permission in order to publish a Gist on the user's behalf.
* If it's the first time, Proxyman will prompt a Github Authorization Page.

## 2. Benefit

* **Instantly** create a Gist from selected Request/Response that you can **quickly** share with your colleagues.
* Support Private and Private Gist.&#x20;
* Only requires **"Read/Write Gist"** permission. No request for Email/Username/...
* The Github Access Token is securely stored in User Keychain.

Here is how the Gist looks like: <https://gist.github.com/NghiaTranUIT/e116a60e286c917a5cbfd61aff32194c>
